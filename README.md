# Custom Qode Fonts
_A WordPress plugin for adding custom fonts to the Bridge theme by Qode_

## Dependencies
- [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](http://advancedcustomfields.com)

Alternatively, you may use:

- Advanced Custom Fields
- ACF Options Page
- ACF Repeater

### Why are you making me buy ACF to use this?
I wrote this plugin for use at my company and didn't feel like developing the admin UI myself. Feel free to contribute. You could fairly easily hard code in the font information as well if you're feeling cheap.
